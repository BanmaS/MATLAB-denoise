Use res_eva.m to get the input and output signals' SNR, SSNR, LSD, PESQ, STOI compared to the noisy signal.
Use test_average.m to get the average evaluation value above of a number of signals using frequency band method (our system).
Please put the clear signals you want to test into 'test/' before running test_average.m.
