# MATLAB-denoise
## Introduction
This is the course project of SJTU EE397 course and project 193 of MathWorks Excellence in Innovation Projects. We learn from the idea of RNNoise and implement a speech noise reduction system based on MATLAB deep learning.
## Remind
* The TrainNetworks folder is used to train and simply test the network, use the ```DenoiseTrain.m``` to start it.
* The code in ```objective comment``` is used to evalute the effect, with the objective comment.
